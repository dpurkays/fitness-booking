# FITNESS 359
# Abstract / Summary
FITNESS 359 performs as a virtual membership card that supports its members during the inconvenience of the contemporary pandemic. This application allows members to book their workout sessions online. This process is to help local gyms with the new restrictions and guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This application allows gyms to be ready for their members’ arrival. We implemented an authentication process that checks a user's account through an internal SQLite database. Implementation of the external database is considered for future submission. Similar to the process of many fitness centers, users are given username and password registered by the center themselves thus, there will be no registration form. After logging in, members have the option to book workout sessions on their own time at their preferred location. FITNESS 359’s users can also change the general theme of the UI, which is stored on SharedPreferences. An embedded map is implemented to show gyms and to facilitate the booking process. Users can monitor their health while working out. This application can track users’ steps and calories burnt.
